## My particle system is a small explosion.
There is an initial burst in the center as all the particles move outwards at different speeds and fade away slowly.
## For the particles attributes:
+ The colour of the particle is set to red
+ All particles start at position 0,0, 0 and move towards y direction, speed is set to 5 units and life span is 256, size is 10
## On each update
+ The particle position is moved according to each direction 
+ Lifespan is decreased by 5 and if it equals 0, the particle is removed from the linked list

Time: 
if execute ./pss 20000000 - it will display something like below:
20000000 particles have been created.
Total time taken by creation in milliseconds: 970
Total time taken by animation in milliseconds: 340
Total time taken by destroy in milliseconds: 300
If you run ./pss 500 - it will display something like below (500 is too small, so the time taken is 0):
500 particles have been created.
Total time taken by creation in milliseconds: 0
Total time taken by animation in milliseconds: 0
Total time taken by destroy in milliseconds: 0
